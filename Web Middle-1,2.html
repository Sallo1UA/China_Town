                        <li><h4>Chin and Dmytro Kosurepo opened the first restaurant eight years ago. In 2015, "China Town" on Ivan Franko Street became an instant hit: the restaurant offered Chinese cuisine in a new format for the city. "It just happened: I lived in a Chinese dormitory with a Chinese. That's why we took this food, found the chef who cooked it best, and incorporated it into a modern interior with great service and music that we like," says Dmytro. The following establishments, dedicated to the gastronomic cultures of Asia, were opened with a similar approach: the country is studied during trips and tastings on the spot, and in the kitchen they trust the carriers of the culture. I ask Chin why this is important for his team. - National cuisine is best prepared by representatives of this nationality. Its subtleties and nuances are absorbed with mother's milk. Of course, a representative of another culture can learn it; it can take many years, but it can be done. The cuisine of, say, Montenegro with grilled octopus and marinated anchovies can be mastered quickly, but the cuisine of China, where there are eight regions and thousands of dishes in each</h4></li>

                        <li><h4>Gastronomic traditions depend on many small things: for example, at what temperature food is cooked. If in Ukraine they simply turn on the burner, the Chinese can change the intensity of the fire three times during the cooking process. Even if it's a dish that takes three minutes to cook. There are nuances that are not known to us at all. Or purely about the perception of dishes: for the Vietnamese, desserts are one thing, but for us it is completely different. What are these fermented beans?<br />- Or pho bo for breakfast.<br />- You can still have pho for breakfast somehow, it will help us with a hangover. Fermented egg yolk as a dessert is another matter. For Thais, for example, pork tartare is normal, and beef tartare is a kind of wildness.<br />
                        Therefore, the tradition, which has been rooted in [culture carriers] for generations, is extremely important for us. And that's why we always make sure to bring people from the country around [whose food culture] we're building a new format. After all, how we usually open projects is that we just go to a country and explore it for a long time. We drive along and across it and practice everywhere. We don't consider ourselves restaurateurs, but food explorers. When we study a certain country, we immerse ourselves very deeply in gastronomic cultures, this is our thrill. And we manage to make a business out of it. This is a classic case of a hobby becoming a job.</h4></li>
